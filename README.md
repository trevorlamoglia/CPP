# Overview

As a software engineer, learning C++, one of the most popular programming languages, is a skill and accomplishment that would benefit myself in my career. The purpose of writing this program is to display my understanding of C++ and learn to have fun with it.

The software I'm writing is a simple login and registration system. It involves a user registration process by asking username and password. Upon successful registration, a user file is created with the credentials. If the user does not exist an error will be shown.

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- Git / GitHub
- C++
- MSYS2

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.

MSYS2 is a collection of tools and libraries providing you with an easy-to-use environment for building, installing and running native Windows software.
